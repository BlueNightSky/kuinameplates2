Alpha notes

15-feb:
- (bossmods) fix resetting nameplateShowFriends to an incorrect value if their visibility is modified by CombatToggle or if the Enable callback is sent during combat
- some config elements have been ~moved around~

14-feb:
- (bossmods) a warning is shown in chat when friendly nameplates are
automatically enabled
- (bossmods) will now listen only to the first addon to call
EnableFriendlyNameplates, callbacks are only registered as needed
- (bossmods) fix issue where auras could stick after the end of an encounter if CONTROL_FRIENDLY was disabled
- (framework) a warning is shown if you're using an alpha. which you are. good job!
