BETA NOTES
3-aug
* remove the config tab list scroll bar because that wasn't going to be useful
for quite some time
* increase default castbar height slightly
* brighten default castbar colour slightly
* add ruRU localisation contributed by BLizzatron (also thanks!)

1-aug
* add placeholder auras checkboxes for stuff and things
* add slash-command shortcuts - i.e. type /knp auras or /knp a to open
directly to the auras config page (this uses page names from the locale)
* remove brackets from around player guild text
* increase default small font size slightly (from 9 to 10)

29-jul
* reimplement custom aura filtering. Use the beta of KuiSpellListConfig to
customise the filter.

27-jul
* config page elements are created on-demand, rather than all at once (which
should slightly reduce the pause when you first open the config interface)

* aura options "use default ui filter" and "use whitelist" have been removed
in preparation for changing the way in which the aura filter can be edited.
KuiSpellList isn't used anymore, so obviously KuiSpellListConfig will have no
effect. Currently it filters in a way similar to the old "use default ui
filter" option (i.e. shows other players' CCs, etc).
* add koKR localisation contributed by yuk6196 (thanks!)
