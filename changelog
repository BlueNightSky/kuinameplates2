Alpha notes

16-feb:
- i have become a streamer's bitch, as such, there is now an option to use blizzard's personal resource frame: /knp > general > "ignore personal nameplate". This also allows you to use blizzard's class resource display on the personal frame (not on targets). And I've also added a feature(tm) whereby blizzard's nameplates will temporarily appear behind mine upon closing interface options.
- (bossmods) will now only warn on enable once per session

15-feb:
- (bossmods) fix resetting nameplateShowFriends to an incorrect value if their visibility is modified by CombatToggle or if the Enable callback is sent during combat
- some config elements have been ~moved around~

14-feb:
- (bossmods) a warning is shown in chat when friendly nameplates are
automatically enabled
- (bossmods) will now listen only to the first addon to call
EnableFriendlyNameplates, callbacks are only registered as needed
- (bossmods) fix issue where auras could stick after the end of an encounter if CONTROL_FRIENDLY was disabled
- (framework) a warning is shown if you're using an alpha. which you are. good job!
