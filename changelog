BETA NOTES
29-jul
* reimplement custom aura filtering. Use the beta of KuiSpellListConfig to customise the filter.

27-jul
* config page elements are created on-demand, rather than all at once (which
should slightly reduce the pause when you first open the config interface)

* aura options "use default ui filter" and "use whitelist" have been removed
in preparation for changing the way in which the aura filter can be edited.
KuiSpellList isn't used anymore, so obviously KuiSpellListConfig will have no
effect. Currently it filters in a way similar to the old "use default ui
filter" option (i.e. shows other players' CCs, etc).
* add koKR localisation contributed by yuk6196 (thanks!)
