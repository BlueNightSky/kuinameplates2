2.14.10.3:
* dump-config now opens an edit box for easier copying

2.14.10.2:
* kill off all out of date versions of BarAuras because people still haven't
updated it. It's on the GitHub repo where you first got it (unless some silly
person repackaged it without asking me. Don't do that).

* fix lua error related to stagger on brewmaster monks

2.14.10:
* bump tocs to 7.2
