Alpha notes

feb-11:
- (boss mods) option added to enable clickthrough when frames are automatically shown
- (auras) PostCreateAuraButton + DisplayAura callbacks now include the aura frame as the first argument

feb-09:
- Unless you are also using DBM's alpha, this release WILL BREAK COMPATIBILITY. This is why you shouldn't use betas. /slap.
- Compatibility with previous BigWigs versions is retained. I think. Let me know.

- (auras) centred auras now implemented in the aura module rather than callbacks in core
- (boss mods) now uses what i've coined an "externally managed" aura frame, so it looks the same as other aura frames
- (boss mods) improved tracking of hidden auras
- (boss mods) fixed compatibility with latest dbm alpha

feb-08:
- (boss mods) base logic for multiple auras. should really just make some way of hooking into the aura plugin but OH WELL
- (boss mods) fix nil error if disable-friendly-nameplates message is called before any auras are shown
- (Boss mods) BigWigs now sends names instead of GUIDs, so handle that
