Alpha notes

feb-21
* add option to disable threat glow
* off tank colours will now only be used if the player is actually in a tanking specialisation when force tank mode is active
* add option to force off-tank detection to get the old behaviour back
* fix boss mods compatibility with latest BigWigs alpha (while retaining compatibility with previous versions)
* boss mods can now switch between sending GUIDs and names at will. This means nothing to you.
* BarAuras and simple-aura-mods have been fixed, if you know where to get them.

feb-20
* fix on PTR (power bar lua errors)
* fix the unmodified personal nameplate is rendered beneath all other nameplates
* only show 3 class power icons on ret paladins, and highlight at 3
