* this update resets the "allow boss mods to control visibility of nameplates" option back to enabled, because it was renamed. Sorry about that.
* boss mods can now forcibly enable hostile nameplates, too. This can be disabled by unchecking /knp > boss mods > "allow boss mods to control visibility..."
* off tank colouring will now only be used if the player is actually in a tanking specialisation when force tank mode is active
* inactive & warlock default class power colours have been changed slightly, again
* show only 3 class power icons on ret paladins, rather than 5
* add option to disable threat glow
* add option to force off-tank colouring while not playing as a tank
* fix boss mods compatibility with future versions of BigWigs (magic)
* fix compatibility with PTR
