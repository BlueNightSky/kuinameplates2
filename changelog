BETA NOTES
27-jul
* aura options "use default ui filter" and "use whitelist" have been removed
in preparation for changing the way in which the aura filter can be edited.
KuiSpellList isn't used anymore, so obviously KuiSpellListConfig will have no
effect. Currently it filters in a way similar to the old "use default ui
filter" option (i.e. shows other players' CCs, etc).
