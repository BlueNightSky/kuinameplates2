Alpha notes

feb-09:
- (auras) centred auras now implemented in the aura module rather than callbacks in core
- (boss mods) now uses what i've coined an "externally managed" aura frame, so it looks the same as other aura frames
- (boss mods) improved tracking of hidden auras
- (boss mods) fixed compatibility with latest dbm alpha

feb-08:
- (boss mods) base logic for multiple auras. should really just make some way of hooking into the aura plugin but OH WELL
- (boss mods) fix nil error if disable-friendly-nameplates message is called before any auras are shown
- (Boss mods) BigWigs now sends names instead of GUIDs, so handle that
