Alpha notes

feb-08:
- (boss mods) base logic for multiple auras. should really just make some way of hooking into the aura plugin but OH WELL
- (boss mods) fix nil error if disable-friendly-nameplates message is called before any auras are shown

- (Boss mods) BigWigs now sends names instead of GUIDs, so handle that
